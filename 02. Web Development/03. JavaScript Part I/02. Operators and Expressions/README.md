#Operators and Expressions

**Exercises:**

01. Write an expression that checks if given integer is ``odd`` or ``even``.

02. Write a ``boolean`` expression that checks for given integer if it can be divided ``(without remainder)`` by 7 and 5 in the same time.

03. Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area by given ``width`` and ``height``.

04. Write an expression that checks for given integer if its ``third digit`` (right-to-left) is 7. E. g. 1732 -> true.

05. Write a boolean expression for finding if the ``bit 3`` (counting from 0) of a given integer is 1 or 0.

06. Write an expression that checks if given print (x,  y) is within a circle K(O, 5).

07. Write an expression that checks if given positive integer number n (n ≤ 100) is prime. E.g. 37 is prime.

08. Write an expression that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides a and b and height h.

09. Write an expression that checks for given point (x, y) if it is within the circle K( (1,1), 3) and out of the rectangle R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2).
