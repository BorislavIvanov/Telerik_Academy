#Code Tuning and Optimization

**Exercisess:**

1. You are given a C# application ([Code-Tuning-and-Optimization-Homework.zip](https://github.com/BorislavIvanov/Telerik_Academy/tree/master/01.%20Programming/04.%20C%23%20High%20Quality%20Code/09.%20Code%20Tuning%20and%20Optimization/01.%20SolarSystem%20-%20Task%20Files)) which displays an animated 3D model of the Solar system.
 * Use a profiler to find the places in its source code which cause significant performance degradation (bottlenecks) - Provide a screenshot of the profiler’s result and indicate the place in the source code where the bottleneck resides    (name of the file, line of code).
 * Make a quick fix in the source code in order to significantly improve the performance. Test the code after the fix for correctness + performance.

2. Write a program to compare the performance of add, subtract, increment, multiply, divide for int, long, float, double and decimal values.

3. Write a program to compare the performance of square root, natural logarithm, sinus for float, double and decimal values.

4. (Difficult task) Write a program to compare the performance of insertion sort, selection sort, quicksort for int, double and string values. Check also the following cases: random values, sorted values, values sorted in reversed order.
