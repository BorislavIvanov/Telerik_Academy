#High-Quality Programming Code – Team Projects – May – July 2014

##Overview

You are given a **C# software project** designed to implement some of the following **console-based games**:
+ Balloon Pops
+ Battle Field
+ Bulls and Cows
+ Game 15
+ Hangman
+ King Survival
+ Labyrinth
+ Minesweeper

The project consists of one or more **source code files** and sometimes contains other files and is provided as ZIP archive. You need to refactor the project in order to **improve its quality** following the best practices learned in the course [“High-Quality Programming Code”](http://telerikacademy.com/Courses/Courses/Details/174) and to **implement unit tests** that ensure that the code has correct behavior.

##Detailed Assignment Description

In order to ensure the high quality of the assigned project you need to fulfill the following tasks:

1. **Perform refactoring of the entire project** (its directory structure, project files, source code, classes, interfaces, methods, properties, fields and other class members and program members and its programming logic) in order to make the code “high quality” according to the best practices introduced in the course “High-Quality Programming Code”. The obtained refactored code should conform to the following characteristics:

 * **Easy to read, understand and maintain** – the code should be well structured; should be easy to read and understand, easy to modify and maintain; should follow the concept of self-documenting code; should use good names for classes, methods, variables, and other identifiers; should be consistently formatted following the best formatting practices; should have strong cohesion at all levels (modules, classes, methods, etc.); should have loose coupling between modules, classes, methods, etc.; should follow the best practices of organizing programming logic at all levels (classes, methods, loops, conditional statements and other statements); should follow the best practices for working with variables, data, expressions, constants, control structures, exceptions, comments, etc.

 * **Correct behavior** – the project should fulfill correctly the requirements and to behave correctly in all possible use cases. This means that all bugs or other problems in the project (e.g. performance or usability issues) should be fixed and any unfinished or missing functionality should be completed. The code should be very well tested with properly designed unit tests.
