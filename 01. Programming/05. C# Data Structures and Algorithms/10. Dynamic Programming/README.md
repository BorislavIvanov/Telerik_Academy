#Dynamic Programming

**Exercises:**

01. Write a program based on dynamic programming to solve the "Knapsack Problem": you are given N products, each has weight Wi and costs Ci and a knapsack of capacity M and you want to put inside a subset of the products with highest cost and weight â‰¤ M. The numbers N, M, Wi and Ci are integers in the range [1..500]. Example: M=10 kg, N=6, products:
