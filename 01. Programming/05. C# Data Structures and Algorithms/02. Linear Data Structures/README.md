#Linear Data Structures

**Exercises:**

01. Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of positive integer numbers. The sequence ends when empty line is entered. Calculate and print the sum and average of the elements of the sequence. Keep the sequence in ``List<int>``.
02. Write a program that reads N integers from the console and reverses them using a stack. Use the ``Stack<int>`` class.
03. Write a program that reads a sequence of integers (``List<int>``) ending with an empty line and sorts them in an increasing order.
04. Write a method that finds the longest subsequence of equal numbers in given ``List<int>`` and returns the result as new ``List<int>``. Write a program to test whether the method works correctly.
05. Write a program that removes from given sequence all ``negative`` numbers.
06. Write a program that removes from given sequence all numbers that occur odd number of times. Example:
``{4, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2} -> {5, 3, 3, 5}``
07. Write a program that finds in given array of integers (all belonging to the range [0..1000]) how many times each of them occurs.
Example: ``array = {3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2}``
  2 -> 2 times
  3 -> 4 times
  4 -> 3 times
08. (Difficult task) The majorant of an array of size N is a value that occurs in it at least N/2 + 1 times. Write a program to find the majorant of given array (if exists). Example:
``{2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3} -> 3``
