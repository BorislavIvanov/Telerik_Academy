Refactor the C# code from the Visual Studio Project "[Refactoring-Homework.zip](https://github.com/BorislavIvanov/Telerik_Academy/tree/master/01.%20Programming/04.%20C%23%20High%20Quality%20Code/12.%20Refactoring/01.%20Refactoring%20-%20Task%20Files)" to improve its internal quality. You might follow the following steps:
 
 * Make some initial refactorings like:
  * Reformat the code.
  * Rename the ugly named variables.
  
 * Make the code testable.
  * Think how to test console-based input / output.
  
 * Write unit tests. Fix any bugs found in the mean time.

 * Refactor the code following the guidelines from this chapter. Do it step by step. Run the unit tests after each major change.
