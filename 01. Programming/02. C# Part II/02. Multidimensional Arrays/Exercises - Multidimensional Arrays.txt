Multidimensional Arrays
Exercises:

01. Write a program that fills and prints a matrix of size (n, n) as shown below: 
(examples for n = 4)

a) 1 5  9 13  b) 1 8  9 16  c) 7 11 14 16 d) 1 12 11 10
   2 6 10 14     2 7 10 15     4 8  12 15    2 13 16  9
   3 7 11 15     3 6 11 14     2 5   9 13    3 14 15  8
   4 8 12 16     4 5 12 13     1 3   6 10    4  5  6  7

02. Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix of size N x M and finds in it the square 3 x 3 that has maximal sum of its elements.

03. We are given a matrix of strings of size N x M. Sequences in the matrix we define as sets of
several neighbor elements located on the same line, column or diagonal. Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal strings in the matrix. Example:

ha  fifi ho hi
fo  ha   hi xx -> ha, ha, ha
xxx ho   ha xx

04. Write a program, that reads from the console an array of N integers and an integer K, sorts the array and using the method
Array.BinSearch() finds the largest number in the array which is ? K. 

05. You are given an array of strings. Write a method that sorts the array by the length of its elements (the number of characters composing them).

06. * Write a class Matrix, to holds a matrix of integers. Overload the operators for adding, subtracting and multiplying of matrices,
indexer for accessing the matrix content and ToString().

07. * Write a program that finds the largest area of equal neighbor elements in a rectangular matrix and prints its size.
Example:

1 3 2 2 2 4
3 3 3 2 4 4
4 3 1 2 3 3 - > 13
4 3 1 3 3 1
4 3 3 3 1 1

Hint: you can use the algorithm "Depth-first search" or "Breadth-first search" (find them in Wikipedia).
