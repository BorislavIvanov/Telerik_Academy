01. Write a JavaScript function reverses string and returns itExample: "sample" -> "elpmas".

02. Write a JavaScript function to check if in a given expression the brackets are put correctly.
 * Example of correct expression: ((a+b)/5-d).
 * Example of incorrect expression: )(a+b)).

03. Write a JavaScript function that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).

 ```
 We are living in an yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the  day. We will move out of it in 5 days.
