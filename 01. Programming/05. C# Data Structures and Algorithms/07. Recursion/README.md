**Exercises:**

02. Write a recursive program for generating and printing all the ``combinations with duplicates`` of k elements from n-element set. Example:
 n=3, k=2 -> (1 1), (1 2), (1 3), (2 2), (2 3), (3 3)

03. Modify the previous program to ``skip duplicates``:
 n=4, k=2 -> (1 2), (1 3), (1 4), (2 3), (2 4), (3 4)

04. Write a recursive program for generating and printing all ``permutations`` of the numbers ``1, 2, ..., n`` for given integer number ``n``. Example:
 n=3 -> {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2},{3, 2, 1}
