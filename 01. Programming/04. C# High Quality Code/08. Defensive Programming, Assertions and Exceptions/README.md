For the exercises use the Visual Studio solution "[9. Assertions-and-Exceptions-Homework.zip](https://github.com/BorislavIvanov/Telerik_Academy/tree/master/01.%20Programming/04.%20C%23%20High%20Quality%20Code/08.%20Defensive%20Programming%2C%20Assertions%20and%20Exceptions/01.%20Task)".
 1. Add assertions in the code from the project "Assertions-Homework" to ensure all possible preconditions and postconditions are checked.
 2. Add exception handling (where missing) and refactor all incorrect error handling in the code from the "Exceptions-Homework" project to follow the best practices for using exceptions.
