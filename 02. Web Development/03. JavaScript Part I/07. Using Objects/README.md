#Using Objects

**Exercises:**

01. Write functions for working with shapes in  standard Planar coordinate system
 * Points are represented by coordinates P(X, Y)
 * Lines are represented by two points, marking their beginning and ending ``L(P1(X1,Y1),P2(X2,Y2))``
 * Calculate the distance between two points
 * Check if three segment lines can form a triangle

02. Write a function that removes all elements with a given value
 var arr = [1,2,1,4,1,3,4,1,111,3,2,1,"1"];
 arr.remove(1); //arr = [2,4,3,4,111,3,2,"1"];
 * Attach it to the array class.
 * Read about prototype and how to attach methods.
