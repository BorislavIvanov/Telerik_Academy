 * Use a profiler to find the places in its source code which cause significant performance degradation (bottlenecks).
 
  \- Provide a screenshot of the profilerâ€™s result and indicate the place in the source code where the bottleneck resides    (name of the file, line of code).

 * Make a quick fix in the source code in order to significantly improve the performance. Test the code after the fix for correctness + performance.
